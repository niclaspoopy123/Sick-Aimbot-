# 360-Degree Threat Detection System

## Overview

Version 2.10 introduces a comprehensive 360-degree threat detection system that provides situational awareness beyond the primary Field of View (FOV). This system continuously scans the environment for players in all directions and alerts you to threats that may be approaching from behind or the sides.

---

## Features

### üîç Complete Environmental Awareness
- **Full 360¬∞ Scanning**: Detects players in all directions, not just forward-facing FOV
- **Visual Indicators**: Orange arrow markers appear on your HUD showing the direction of threats
- **Smart Filtering**: Only shows threats outside your primary FOV to avoid clutter
- **Distance-Based Detection**: Configurable minimum and maximum threat detection ranges

### ‚ö° Performance Optimized
- **Interval-Based Scanning**: Scans every 0.2 seconds instead of every frame
- **Minimal Performance Impact**: Uses efficient calculations to avoid impacting aimbot performance
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes indicators when threats leave range or are eliminated

### üéÆ User-Friendly Controls
- **Toggle On/Off**: Easy button to enable or disable threat detection
- **Visual Feedback**: Indicators automatically update as threats move
- **Non-Intrusive**: Positioned around screen center without blocking view

---

## How It Works

### Detection Logic

1. **Scanning Phase** (every 0.2 seconds):
   - Checks all connected players in the game
   - Calculates distance from your character
   - Filters players within threat range (50-300 studs by default)

2. **FOV Filtering**:
   - Only considers players outside your primary aimbot FOV
   - Prevents duplicate alerts for targets already visible

3. **Angle Calculation**:
   - Determines the horizontal angle from your camera to each threat
   - Projects positions onto a 2D plane for accurate directional indicators

4. **Indicator Display**:
   - Creates/updates orange arrow indicators around screen center
   - Positions indicators based on threat direction
   - Rotates arrows to point toward threats

### Visual Indicators

```
         ‚ñ≤ Threat Above
         |
  ‚óÑ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Your View
         |
         ‚ñº Threat Below
```

- **Orange Arrows**: Point toward the direction of threats
- **Positioned**: Around screen center at configurable distance (120px default)
- **Dynamic**: Update in real-time as threats move

## Configuration

### Default Settings

```lua
-- 360-Degree Threat Detection Settings
THREAT_DETECTION_ENABLED = true,        -- Enable by default
THREAT_SCAN_INTERVAL = 0.2,             -- Scan every 0.2 seconds
THREAT_MIN_DISTANCE = 50,               -- Minimum threat distance (studs)
THREAT_MAX_DISTANCE = 300,              -- Maximum threat distance (studs)
THREAT_INDICATOR_SIZE = 30,             -- Indicator size in pixels
THREAT_INDICATOR_COLOR = Color3.fromRGB(255, 165, 0),  -- Orange
THREAT_INDICATOR_DISTANCE = 120         -- Distance from screen center
```

### Customization Options

#### Scan Interval
```lua
THREAT_SCAN_INTERVAL = 0.2  -- Default: 0.2 seconds
```
- **Lower values** (0.1): More responsive, higher CPU usage
- **Higher values** (0.3-0.5): Less CPU usage, slightly delayed updates
- **Recommended**: 0.2 seconds for best balance

#### Detection Range
```lua
THREAT_MIN_DISTANCE = 50    -- Minimum distance
THREAT_MAX_DISTANCE = 300   -- Maximum distance
```
- **Close Range** (30-150): Good for indoor combat
- **Medium Range** (50-300): Default, balanced for most scenarios
- **Long Range** (100-500): Open area combat

#### Indicator Appearance
```lua
THREAT_INDICATOR_SIZE = 30              -- Size in pixels
THREAT_INDICATOR_COLOR = Color3.fromRGB(255, 165, 0)  -- Color
THREAT_INDICATOR_DISTANCE = 120         -- Distance from center
```
- Adjust size for visibility preferences
- Change color to match your UI preferences
- Increase/decrease distance for different screen sizes

## Usage Guide

### Basic Operation

1. **Enable/Disable**:
   - Click the "360¬∞ Detection: On/Off" button in the GUI
   - Enabled by default on script load

2. **Reading Indicators**:
   - Arrow appears ‚Üí Threat detected in that direction
   - Arrow position ‚Üí Relative direction to threat
   - Arrow disappears ‚Üí Threat eliminated or out of range

3. **Response Actions**:
   - See arrow behind you ‚Üí Consider repositioning
   - Multiple arrows ‚Üí You're surrounded, find cover
   - Arrow approaches FOV edge ‚Üí Threat entering primary view

### Tactical Usage

#### Solo Combat
- Use indicators to avoid being flanked
- Rotate to face incoming threats before they reach FOV
- Maintain awareness during extended engagements

#### Team Combat
- Coordinate with teammates about threat directions
- Cover different angles based on threat indicators
- Call out flanking attempts detected by the system

#### Movement & Positioning
- Check for threats before moving to new positions
- Use indicators to choose safe retreat paths
- Avoid areas with multiple simultaneous threats

## Performance Considerations

### CPU Impact
- **Minimal**: ~0.05-0.1ms per scan cycle
- **Optimized**: Only scans every 0.2 seconds
- **Efficient**: Uses pre-calculated camera vectors

### Memory Usage
- **Small**: One indicator per active threat
- **Managed**: Automatic cleanup of unused indicators
- **Stable**: No memory leaks or accumulation

### Comparison to Primary Aimbot
- **Primary Aimbot**: ~0.8ms per frame (optimized)
- **Threat Detection**: ~0.05ms per scan (every 0.2s)
- **Combined Impact**: <5% additional load

## Troubleshooting

### Indicators Not Appearing

**Possible Causes**:
1. Feature disabled ‚Üí Check toggle button status
2. No threats in range ‚Üí Adjust detection distances
3. Threats within FOV ‚Üí System only shows out-of-FOV threats

**Solutions**:
- Enable via GUI button
- Increase `THREAT_MAX_DISTANCE`
- Test with players at various distances

### Too Many Indicators

**Possible Causes**:
1. Detection range too large
2. High player count in area

**Solutions**:
- Reduce `THREAT_MAX_DISTANCE`
- Increase `THREAT_MIN_DISTANCE`
- Focus on closest threats first

### Performance Issues

**Possible Causes**:
1. Scan interval too low
2. Very high player count

**Solutions**:
- Increase `THREAT_SCAN_INTERVAL` to 0.3-0.5
- Consider disabling in extreme player counts
- Reduce detection range

## Technical Details

### Algorithm Complexity

**Per Scan Cycle**:
```
O(n) where n = number of connected players
```

**Operations Per Player**:
1. Distance calculation: O(1)
2. FOV check: O(1)
3. Angle calculation: O(1)
4. Indicator update: O(1)

**Total**: O(n) with very low constant factors

### Coordinate System

The system uses a horizontal plane projection:
```lua
-- Project 3D positions to 2D horizontal plane
toTargetFlat = Vector3.new(toTarget.X, 0, toTarget.Z).Unit

-- Calculate angle using dot products
angle = math.atan2(dotRight, dotForward)
```

This ensures indicators represent horizontal directions regardless of vertical position.

### Indicator Positioning

```lua
-- Position calculated from angle and distance
posX = centerX + math.cos(angle) * THREAT_INDICATOR_DISTANCE
posY = centerY + math.sin(angle) * THREAT_INDICATOR_DISTANCE
```

Forms a circle around screen center with radius = `THREAT_INDICATOR_DISTANCE`.
